## Objective Definition
We aim to predict the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan. Our definition of 'default' might be instances such as missing three consecutive payments.

## Data Collection
We'll source datasets from platforms like Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository, ensuring they encompass features like financial history, employment status, and customer demographics.

## Data Preprocessing
This phase involves:
- Cleaning the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Converting categorical variables into numerical formats, potentially using one-hot encoding.
- Standardizing or normalizing numerical features for consistent scales.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our exploration will:
- Examine distributions of key variables.
- Identify potential correlations between features.
- Understand the balance between default and non-default cases.

## Feature Engineering
To enhance our model's predictive power, we'll:
- Generate new features from the existing dataset.
- Utilize financial domain knowledge to incorporate influential factors, such as a Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.

## Model Selection
Given the classification nature of our problem, we'll explore:
- Logistic Regression (for a baseline model)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosted Trees
- Neural Networks
We'll prioritize models that provide insights into feature importance.

## Training & Validation
Key steps here include:
- Segmenting the data into distinct training, validation, and test sets.
- Implementing cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
- Addressing any class imbalance issues, potentially with techniques like SMOTE.

## Evaluation
Our evaluation metrics for this binary classification problem will be:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC and AUC
Special attention will be given to the implications of false negatives vs. false positives.

## Model Interpretability
Ensuring the decisions of our model are transparent and justifiable is crucial. Methods like SHAP or LIME will be considered for this.

## Deployment
If feasible, we'll:
- Deploy the trained model using tools like Flask.
- Design a user interface for loan officers to input customer data and retrieve a risk score.

## Documentation & Presentation
Every step will be meticulously documented, preferably using Jupyter notebooks. Our presentation will elucidate our methodology, findings, the effectiveness of our model, and the anticipated business impact.

## Feedback & Iteration
Upon completing the initial model, we'll actively seek feedback and make refinements based on the insights gathered.
